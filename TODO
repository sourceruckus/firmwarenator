- Maybe take an arugument specifying specific extra files to add to the fw
  image.  This is handy if you've created one, but you notice it's missing a
  particular file for whatever reason.  W/out this ability, you have to fix the
  fw problem by hand in order to get the correct "Loading firmware from..."
  messages in dmesg.  (Either by hand-creating the fw.img or by
  removing/reloading modules that requested firmware)

- Maybe also look through dmesg output for "Direct firmware load for
  ... failed" messages and attempt to include the requested but missing files
  in the fw image?

- Maybe take argument specifying path to alternate firmware dir (default is
  /lib/firmware).  I don't think I can do this... it's a chicken and the egg
  problem.  We leverage the kernel's fw loading code so that we can ensure that
  all the fw that WOULD be loaded is actually present in the image.  We *could*
  supply this flag, but it would break that guarantee... no likey.

- Switch to zstd once i've disowned bionic.  Not really a ton of savings there
  (space or speed), because our per-machine fw.sqsh should be tiny.

- Put more instructions on fw.sqsh and fw.img usage somewhere. (e.g., how
  exactly to add fw.img to an existing initramfs image).  Some of this is in
  the ruckusrd manpage, but we could add more details here.
